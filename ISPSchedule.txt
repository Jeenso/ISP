Since the process of making a game/software might change unexpectedly (i.e. more time spent on debugging, unsatisfactory product) I am keeping the schedule vague. My final schedule/journal will have my work logged by the hour. My schedule is roughly following the Software Development Life Cycle. I do not know if it reflects the real cycle accurately since I am fitting development into 2-4 weeks. Generally I’d try to work from 8 AM-5 PM with breaks.
